	<h3>Installation</h3>
        
Deploy "Netscaler WAF Security for Splunk" like every other App by uploading  it using the WebGUI or extracting it to $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps. 
Restart Splunk afterwards.
<br/><br/>
In a distributed environment the app has to be deployed to every Search head and Indexer. Make sure the app is also deployed on the Host or 
Forwarder receiving the events from the Netscaler devices. 
<br/><br/>
With default settings the app will create an index “netscaler” and a TCP input on port 10005 using sourcetype citrix:netscaler. You can customize these 
settings by changing the TCP port in inputs.conf.
